                little to praise about the Vision Pro and instead found his company's rival product, Meta Quest 3, to be
                more appealing to a wider audience.In a video shared on his Instagram profile, Zuckerberg wrote, “I have
                to
                say that before this, I expected that Quest would be the better value for most people since it's really
                good
                and it's like seven times less expensive. But after using it, I don't just think that Quest is better
                value,
                I think Quest is better product period."The ensuing video involved Zuckerberg talking more about the
                Meta
                Quest 3 than the Vision Pro and detailing all the ways in which his company's product is better than
                Apple's. However, did have a few good things to say about the Vision Pro noting that its screen has a
                higher
                resolution and that Apple's eye tracking is really nice.</p>
